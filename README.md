# OpenSpaceCharge





The OpenSC package is an open-source software library written primarily in Fortran 2008 for calculating space charge fields [1]. It was originally developed as a reusable Poisson solver with free-space boundary conditions for use within the Warp framework [2], and will be incorporated into the Particle-In-Cell Scalable Application Resource, PICSAR [3].

OpenSC currently implements free-space and rectangular conducting pipe methods using integrated Green functions (IGFs) as described in [4] and [5], respectively. The package provides high-level routines to:

- Deposit weighted charged particles on a 3Drectangular grid.

- Calculate the space charge fields on this grid (various methods).

- Interpolate the field to an arbitrary point within its domain.
